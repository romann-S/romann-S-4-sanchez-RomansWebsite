<p style="font-size: 20px">My name is Roman, and I’m a 10th grader at El Camino High School. I’ve always been interested in creativity, especially through graphic design and making 3D models that I can print out and bring to life. Designing gives me a way to express myself and build something unique.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Outside of design, I love riding my bike and popping wheelies, which has become one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, whether it’s just chilling or finding something fun to do. My favorite spot to eat is In-N-Out, since nothing beats a good burger and fries.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px"> When it comes to music and games, I like keeping a balance of calm and fun. I listen to artists like Drake and J. Cole when I want to relax, and I play games like Fortnite and Siege when I want some excitement. Between school, hobbies, and time with friends, I always find ways to keep life interesting.</p>
